## Description
A comprehensive, all-in-one adblock list for thorough blocking of trackers, popup ads, ads,
unwanted cookies, fake news, cookie warning messages, unwanted comment sections,
crypto-coin mining, YouTube clutter and social network hassles.

Tested in uBlock Origin for Google Chrome, Firefox and Edge; it should work just
fine in any decent adblocker that supports Adblock Plus 2.0 formatted lists.

It includes customized entries that block particularly annoying page elements.
It is actively maintained (updates every 2 hours) and is saved in UTF-8 format. Have fun :D

**(VITAL:)**
Be sure to disable any lists that appear in the list below that you already have active in
the settings/dashboard. e.g. https://i.imgur.com/fZGfQi4.png

## Usage
In your adblocker's filter lists section add either the URL:

https://bit.ly/AIO-adblock

**OR**

Check the wiki for step-by-step instructions. (https://github.com/hl2guide/All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List/wiki)

## News
Version 2.3 of the AIO list is more complete and potent than ever. Optimized, consolidated and duplicate lines are removed :D

## What's in Version 2.3?

1. Added more adblock lists for even more protection
2. Added emoji for easily identifying list in an adblocker by title
3. Tested in browsers: Firefox and Google Chrome
4. Tested in addons/extensions: uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus

## Windows Recommendations

1. Personally I use a custom Windows HOSTS file to handle the initial blocking. [updated every 2 days]

3. Then I clear browser caches often and make sure all cookies are removed
